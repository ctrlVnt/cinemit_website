## How to Contribute

### 1. Fork the Repository
Before making any changes, please fork the main repository. You can do this by clicking on the **Fork** button at the top right on GitHub. This will create a copy of the project in your account.

### 2. Clone the Repository
Clone the forked repository to your local machine using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-name.git
```

### 3. Create a New Branch
It's always a good idea to work on a new branch for each modification you propose:
```bash
git checkout -b branch-name
```
Choose a descriptive name for the branch that reflects the type of changes you are making (e.g., `fix-bug` or `feature-add-function`).

### 4. Make Your Changes
Now you are ready to make your changes. Be sure to follow the style guidelines and test the code locally before proceeding.

### 5. Commit and Push Your Changes
After making the changes, create a commit with a meaningful message:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Description of the changes made"
```
Then push the branch with the changes to your GitHub repository:
```bash
git push origin branch-name
```

### 6. Open a Pull Request
Now that your changes are pushed, it's time to open a **Pull Request** (PR):
- Go to the original repository (the one you forked from).
- Click on the "New Pull Request" button.
- Select the branch you just pushed and complete the description of your PR.
- Provide a detailed explanation of what you changed and why.

### 7. Feedback and Review
Your contribution will be reviewed by one of the main project collaborators. You may receive requests for changes or suggestions for further improvements.

### 8. Code of Conduct
